# My Parking Lot

## Introduction
Welcome to *My Parking Lot*. This is a business simulation game. Basically, the user needs to control vehicles to be 
into and out of parking spaces. Every time the user handles a vehicle successfully, the corresponding amount of money 
will be added to the balance. And the user needs to reach a goal to win the game. 

This application is designed for people who are passionate in business games and want to try something new. And this 
game is also suitable for kids, which can be their first lesson in life about business. 

I am currently in a job about teaching kids programming. In the process of work, I find it is effective for kids to gain
knowledge through games. So, I come up with this idea and hope kids can try simple business in this application.
 
## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add new vehicles to the parking lot system
- As a user, I want to be able to assign vehicles to vacant spaces and remove the assignments.
- As a user, I want to be able to view an existing vehicle's information.
- As a user, I hope the system can periodically and randomly select a car from existing vehicles to be ready to 
move out.
- As a user, I hope there will be an addition in my balance once I serve a vehicle successfully and subtraction once I
fail to response to a vehicle's requirement.
