# Parking Lot Management System

## Introduction
Welcome to *My Parking Lot*, the most efficient parking lot management tool in the world. This application is designed 
for all parking lots. With this tool, the safety of parking lots will be improved. This tool can be used to update and 
view the all the vehicles' information in the parking lot in real time. And it can also be used to calculate and view 
the overall parking fees.

There is a multi-storey car park in my neighbourhood. I find there are neither guards, nor some device to record vehicle
entry or exit information. This may lead to some safety problem and cause inconvenience to residents(For example, no
reminder when the park is full). So, I design this application.
